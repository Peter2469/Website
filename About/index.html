                Hello, my name is Peter Nokes and I am a Computer Science student with prior extensive experience programming in multiple frontend and backend languages.<br><br>
                Since I was young I have always been interested in computers and was keen to learn how they operated;
                to achieve this goal, since the age of 15, I have learnt how to program in Python, HTML, CSS and JavaScript and use software like Git in my own free time.<br><br>
                
                I have also learnt how to use and operate with the Linux Operating System in both a Server and a Desktop environment. Which includes but isn't limited to:<br><br>
                - Server Management<br>
                - Terminal Usage<br>
                - File Management<br>
                - Setting up Apache2<br><br>
