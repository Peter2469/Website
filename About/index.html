                    Hello, my name is Peter Nokes and I am a graduate Computer Science student with prior extensive experience programming in multiple frontend and backend languages.<br><br>
                    
                    From a young age I was fascinated by computers; I explored
                    programming languages like Python, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript andactively learnt by developing projects to help develop these skills.<br><br>
                    
                    Taking part of the Linux and Open Source communities throughout the years, 
                    I have collaborated and communicated the latest advancements in the field. For instance, I have worked on “ALS” a
                    full-stack web application programmed in React; This has helped enhance my technical abilities and learning to value teamwork
                    and effective communication and research.<br><br>

                    I have also learnt how to use and operate with the Linux Operating System in both a Server and a Desktop environment. Which includes but isn't limited to:<br><br>
                    - Server Management<br>
                    - Terminal Usage<br>
                    - File Management<br>
                    - Setting up Apache2
                    </p>
                </h2>
