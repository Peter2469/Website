                <p class="Biography">
                    I'm Peter Nokes, a Computer Science Graduate with a passion for programming and a strong foundation in both frontend and backend languages. My journey into the world of technology began at a young age, growing up surrounded by computers both at home and in educational settings. This early exposure sparked my curiosity about the inner workings of computers, setting me on a path of continuous learning and exploration.<br><br>

                    My programming journey kicked off at the age of 15 when I started learning Python. I didn't just stop at learning the language; I actively engaged in creating projects that kept me excited and motivated. Along the way, I joined online communities where I could not only enhance my skills but also share knowledge and advice with like-minded individuals. This collaborative environment allowed me to tackle complex projects that might have otherwise seemed daunting.<br><br>

                    In addition to my programming experience, I've been actively immersing myself in the world of DevOps, with a particular focus on AWS (Amazon Web Services). I believe that learning this skilset is essential in today's tech landscape, and I'm committed to mastering this.<br><br>

                    Furthermore, my journey into this industry has also led me to become proficient in operating within the Linux ecosystem, both in server and desktop environments. This proficiency encompasses various skills, including server management, adept use of the terminal, efficient file management, and even the setup and configuration of services like Apache2.
